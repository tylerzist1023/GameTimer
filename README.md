# GameTimer
App that tracks your playtime.

# Setting up
Download the release. When you run the program for the first time, it will create a ```times.xml``` file, but will crash before showing up on the screen. You need to open the ```times.xml``` file and manually add the following:
```
<times>
</times>
```
The program is supposed to do that automatically but it doesn't work for some reason, and I'm too lazy to fix it. Once that is done, you should not have any more issues.
